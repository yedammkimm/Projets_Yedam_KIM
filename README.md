# Projets â€“ Yedam KIM

This repository collects my various programming and engineering projects, developed both during my studies at Polytech Sorbonne and in my own time. Projects cover a range of languages, technologies, and subjects explored since the start of my engineering curriculum.

## School Projects

- **Langage C**  
  Systems programming projects in C, including OS simulations, algorithms, and data structure implementations as part of coursework.

- **Vhdl**  
  Digital logic design and FPGA programming using VHDL. Assignments included clock designs and state machines.

- **Assembleur**  
  Low-level programming in assembly language for microcontrollers and computer architecture labs.

- **Ocaml**  
  Functional programming exercises and small applications using OCaml.

- **SQL**  
  Database theory and SQL practice, including designing and querying relational databases.

- **Projet IOT_ruche**  
  IoT (Internet of Things) project: sensor-based system for monitoring beehive (ruche) conditions, including microcontroller programming, data collection, and basic analysis.

- **Python**  
  Various scripts and tools for automation, data processing, and problem solving in Python.

- **Other mini-projects**  
  Additional small projects, prototypes, and experiments done independently to deepen my skills in programming and electronics.
