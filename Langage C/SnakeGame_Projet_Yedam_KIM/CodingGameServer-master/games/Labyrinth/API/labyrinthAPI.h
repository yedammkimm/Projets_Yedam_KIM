 * Parameters:
 * - training: string (max 50 characters) type of the training
 *             player we want to play with
 *             (empty string for regular game)
 * - labyrinthName: string (max 50 characters), 
 *                  corresponds to the game name
 * - sizeX, sizeY: sizes of the labyrinth
 *
 * training is a string like "NAME key1=value1 key2=value1 ..."
 * - NAME can be empty. It gives the type of the training player
 * - key=value pairs are used for options 
 *   (each training player has its own options)
 *   invalid keys are ignored, invalid values leads to error
 *   the following options are common to every training player
 *   (when NAME is not empty or not TOURNAMENT):
 *        - 'timeout': allows an define the timeout
 *                   when training (in seconds)
 *        - 'seed': allows to set the seed of the random generator
 *        - 'start': allows to set who starts ('0' or '1')
 * the NAME could be:
 * - "DO_NOTHING" to play against DO_NOTHING player 
 *   (player that does not move)
 * - "PLAY_RANDOM" for a player that make random (legal) moves 
 *   (option "rotate=False/True")
 * - "ASTAR" for a player that move the shortest way to the treasure
 *   (without making any rotation)
 * training also be : "TOURNAMENT name" where name is the name of the tournament
 * as it has been created using the web page
