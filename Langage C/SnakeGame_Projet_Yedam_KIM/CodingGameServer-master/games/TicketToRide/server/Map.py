File: Map.py
	Contains the class Map for the TicketToRide game
	-> defines a map


To create a new map,
a) add its name in the definition of TicketToRide.map (see TicketToRide.py linee 62)
b) create a folder (with the same name as the map) in games/TicketToRide/maps/
c) with the following files
  - cities.csv:     list of cities (number;cityName)
  - tracks.csv:     list of tracks (city1;city2;length;track1 color;track2 color)
  - map.txt:        raw text for the map
