"""
This file is a template for a new Game in CGS

The two main methods to fill in are:
	- the __init__ to build the game (you put all the intern data here)
	- the updateMove, to check if a move is legal, to play it (and change the intern state of the game),
	and returns if the move is legal or not

Then, you should also fill:
	- the __str__ method, that build the string returns to the player to display the game
	- the getDataSize and getData methods, for the client to know the initial state of the game
	- the getDictInformations, to display the game on webpages
