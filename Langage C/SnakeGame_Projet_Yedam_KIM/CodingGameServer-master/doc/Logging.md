# Global logging rules### Debug modesThree modes are used: `debug`, `dev` and `prod`  - `debug`: (debug) everything is logged and display  - `dev`: (development) almost everything is logged, important things are displayed  - `prod`: (production) only important messages are logged and displayed; emails are sent for errors### LevelsThe following level are used (MESSAGE and LOW_DEBUG are added from standard levels):  - ERROR: Unexepected errors that occurs during execution (should never happend, in theory)  - MESSAGE: General messages (like "Start the server", "a game starts", etc.)  - WARNING: some warning (ununsed, yet)  - INFO: Messages about the game/players (like "player xxx plays yyy")         - DEBUG: Debug messages (like every client-server command sent)  - LOW_DEBUG: Low level debug messages (like client-server messages, websocket, etc.)### log filesThree types of log files are produced:- the main log contains all the logs(but filtered by level). It has three handlers:   - the file `activity.log`   - the console   - the email (only in `prod` mode, to report errors). The email address and the smtp can be configured in command line. The option `--noemail` allows to disable it- the `error.log` file that contains all the errors (should be empty, in ideal world)- the logs files for each player, game and tournamentBy default, the files are located in `games/<gameName>/<hostname>/logs/` (where `<gameName>` is the name of the game, and `<hostname>` the name of the server. This is usefull in our context, where we run several servers, on several machines, *but* with the same account).The location can be changed with the option `--logs=<folder>` in the command line (in that case, the logs are located in `games/<gameName>/<folder>`).The log files for each player, game and tournament are stored in subfolders named `Games`, `Players` and `Tournaments`, respectively.#### Main log (`activity.log`, display and email)|           |   |         | Prod |       |   |   Dev   |     |   |  Debug   |     ||-----------|---|:-------:|:----:|:-----:|---|:-------:|:---:|---|:--------:|:---:||           |   | console |  log | email |   | console | log |   |  console | log || ERROR     |   |    x    |   x  |   x   |   |    x    |  x  |   |    x     |  x  || MESSAGE   |   |    x    |   x  |       |   |    x    |  x  |   |    x     |  x  || WARNING   |   |         |   x  |       |   |    x    |  x  |   |    x     |  x  || INFO      |   |         |      |       |   |    x    |  x  |   |    x     |  x  || DEBUG     |   |         |      |       |   |         |  x  |   |    x     |  x  || LOW_DEBUG |   |         |      |       |   |         |     |   |          |  x  |The maximum size for `activity.log` is fixed to 1Mb (when the log file weight more than 1Mo, it is cut, and the last Mo is put in `activity.log.1`)#### `error.log` file|           | Prod | Dev | Debug ||-----------|:----:|:---:|:-----:|| ERROR     |   x  |  x  |   x   || MESSAGE   |      |  x  |   x   || WARNING   |      |     |       || INFO      |      |     |       || DEBUG     |      |     |       || LOW_DEBUG |      |     |       |The maximum size for `error.log` is fixed to 1Mb, too.#### Game, Player and Tournament log files  (one log file per game, player or tournament)        |           | Prod | Dev | Debug ||-----------|:----:|:---:|:-----:|| ERROR     |   x  |  x  |   x   || MESSAGE   |   x  |  x  |   x   || WARNING   |   x  |  x  |   x   || INFO      |   x  |  x  |   x   || DEBUG     |      |  x  |   x   || LOW_DEBUG |      |     |   x   |The maximum sizes are set to:|                 | Game | Player | Tournament ||-----------------|:----:|:------:|:----------:|| max file size   | 10kb |  100kb |     1Mb    || max folder size |  1Mb |   5Mb  |     1Mb    |### SettingsAll these settings are defined in the file `server/Logger.py` (TODO: put these settings in the games, not necesseraly in the server, so that each game can have its own settings)
